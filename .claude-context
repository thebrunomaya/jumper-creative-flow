    decision: "Refactored Step 3 (Analyze) prompts to modular database structure"
    status: "completed ✅"
    details: |
      REFACTORING: Standardized Step 3 (Analyze) prompt structure to match Steps 1 & 2

      PROBLEM:
      - Step 3 had hardcoded prompt in Edge Function (lines 145-193)
      - Steps 1 and 2 already used modular j_ads_optimization_prompts table
      - Inconsistent structure across optimization pipeline
      - Gestores couldn't edit analysis prompts via UI

      SOLUTION:
      1. Fixed prompt_type search: 'analysis' → 'analyze' (line 145)
      2. Added account context fetching (contexto_transcricao, contexto_otimizacao)
      3. Converted system prompt to English (structural instructions)
      4. Restructured user prompt with standardized sections:
         - PROPER NAMES AND CONTEXT
         - PLATFORM & OBJECTIVES
         - FOCUS BY OBJECTIVE (from database)
         - ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT
         - PROCESSED TRANSCRIPTION (ORGANIZED BULLETS)
         - ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
         - TASK
      5. Added "OUTPUT LANGUAGE: Brazilian Portuguese"

      STRUCTURE NOW CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL 3 STEPS:
      - Step 1 (Transcribe): System prompt (EN) + User prompt (sections) ✅
      - Step 2 (Process): System prompt (EN) + User prompt (sections) ✅
      - Step 3 (Analyze): System prompt (EN) + User prompt (sections) ✅

      BENEFITS:
      - All prompts editable via /optimization UI
      - Version tracking (previous_version field)
      - Consistent structure easier to maintain
      - Better AI comprehension with clear separators
    impact: "High - Complete modularization of prompt system"

    decision: "Fixed AI Improvements debug modal to show original Whisper prompt"
    status: "completed ✅"
    details: |
      FEATURE: Debug modal now displays the actual Whisper prompt used in transcription

      PROBLEM:
      - "Original Whisper Prompt Used" showed "N/A" in AI improvements debug
      - Whisper prompt is not stored in j_ads_optimization_recordings
      - Prompt is dynamically built and saved in j_ads_optimization_api_logs

      SOLUTION:
      - OptimizationEditor now fetches Whisper prompt from transcription log
      - Queries j_ads_optimization_api_logs with step='transcribe', success=true
      - Passes originalWhisperPrompt to AIImprovementsModal
      - Modal sends it to Edge Function for context

      IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
      1. Added state: originalWhisperPrompt in OptimizationEditor
      2. Added query in useEffect to fetch prompt from logs
      3. Updated AIImprovementsModal prop from recording.whisper_prompt to originalWhisperPrompt
      4. Improved prompt structure in Edge Function with clear separators (============)
      5. Updated to Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

      NEW PROMPT STRUCTURE:
      - Clear section separators with ============
      - Explicit section titles (CONTEXT, CURRENT TRANSCRIPTION, etc.)
      - Better hierarchy for AI understanding
      - Clear OUTPUT FORMAT instructions
    impact: "Medium - Better debugging and improved AI accuracy"
    files_changed:
      - "supabase/functions/j_hub_optimization_improve_transcript/index.ts"
      - "src/pages/OptimizationEditor.tsx"

  - date: "2025-10-11"
    decision: "Fixed CHECK constraint on j_ads_optimization_api_logs.step"
    status: "completed ✅"
    details: |
      BUG FIX: AI improvements logs were not being saved

      PROBLEM:
      - Edge function executed successfully but debug modal showed "Nenhum log encontrado"
      - SQL query returned 0 rows for step='improve_transcript'
      - Supabase logs showed: "violates check constraint j_ads_optimization_api_logs_step_check"

      ROOT CAUSE:
      - Table had CHECK constraint limiting step values to: ('transcribe', 'process', 'analyze')
      - New value 'improve_transcript' was not in allowed list
      - All insert attempts silently failed

      SOLUTION:
      - Created migration 20251011201000_fix_api_logs_step_constraint.sql
      - Dropped old CHECK constraint
      - Created new constraint including 'improve_transcript'
      - Applied via npx supabase db push

      LESSON LEARNED:
      - CHECK constraint violations don't throw obvious errors
      - Always verify table constraints when adding new enum-like values
      - Debug modal was essential to discover this issue
    impact: "High - Critical fix, AI improvements logs now save correctly"

    decision: "Implemented comprehensive user management panel for admins"
    status: "completed ✅"
    details: |
      FEATURE: Complete admin panel for user management at /admin/users

      BACKEND:
      - Created j_ads_user_audit_log table for tracking all admin actions
      - Added activity tracking columns to j_ads_users (last_login_at, login_count, is_active)
      - Deployed j_ads_admin_users Edge Function with actions:
        * list: Get all users with stats (accounts, creatives, logins)
        * getDetails: Full user details with audit history
        * changeRole: Change user permissions with validation
        * toggleStatus: Activate/deactivate accounts
        * resetPassword: Send password reset email
        * forceLogout: Revoke all user sessions

      FRONTEND:
      - AdminUsers page (/admin/users) with complete UI
      - 5 new components: UserCard, UserDetailsModal, ChangeRoleDialog, UserMetrics, UserFilters
      - Search by name/email + filters by role/status
      - Clickable metric cards for quick filtering
      - Mobile-responsive design

      SECURITY:
      - Only admins can access the panel
      - All actions logged to audit table
      - Prevents removing last admin
      - RLS policies on audit log

      KEY DECISIONS:
      - Did NOT change role nomenclature (kept admin/manager/supervisor/gerente/user)
      - Focused on management features, not restructuring permissions
      - Safe implementation - zero breaking changes
    impact: "High - Major new feature for admin operations"

    decision: "Cleaned up obsolete migration files from local repository"
    status: "completed ✅"
    details: |
      CLEANUP: Deleted 23 migration files that were already applied remotely

      ISSUE: Supabase CLI showing migration mismatch - files existed locally
      but were already applied in production database (via Dashboard).

      SOLUTION:
      - Deleted 23 local migration files (2025-10-07 to 2025-10-10)
      - These were applied manually via Dashboard, not via CLI
      - Local files were causing "remote database's migration history does not match"

      LESSON LEARNED: Always use CLI for migrations (npx supabase db push)
      to keep local and remote in sync. Avoid applying via Dashboard.
    impact: "Low - Cleanup only, no functional changes"
    files_changed:
      - "Deleted 23 files in supabase/migrations/"

    status: "completed ✅"
    details: |
      BRANDING: Replaced favicon with new J-Hub orange logo

      - Copied j-hub-icon.png from Desktop
      - Replaced public/favicon.png and public/favicon.ico
      - New icon: Orange Jumper logo on black background
      - Will appear after Vercel deploy + browser cache clear

    decision: "Removed password authentication from shared optimizations"
    status: "completed ✅"
    details: |
      PROBLEM: Password-protected sharing wasn't working - always returned 401

      ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERY:
      - Edge function j_ads_view_shared_optimization was NOT in config.toml
      - Supabase blocked ALL requests with 401 "Missing authorization header"
      - Function code NEVER executed - blocking happened before
      - Real issue: Missing verify_jwt = false configuration

      SOLUTION:
      - Removed password validation from j_ads_view_shared_optimization
      - Removed password generation from j_ads_create_optimization_share
      - Added verify_jwt = false in config.toml for public access
      - Security via unique random slug only

      LESSON LEARNED: Always check config.toml FIRST when edge function returns 401!
    impact: "High - Simplified sharing, removed complexity"
    files_changed:
      - "supabase/functions/j_ads_view_shared_optimization/index.ts"

  ✅ SESSION 2025-10-12 (EVENING) COMPLETED: Step 3 Prompt Refactoring

  What was done in this session:
    1. ✅ Refactored j_hub_optimization_analyze/index.ts to modular structure
    2. ✅ Fixed prompt_type search from 'analysis' to 'analyze'
    3. ✅ Added account context fetching (contexto_transcricao, contexto_otimizacao)
    4. ✅ Converted system prompt to English (structural instructions)
    5. ✅ Restructured user prompt with standardized sections (matching Steps 1 & 2)
    6. ✅ Deployed j_hub_optimization_analyze to production

  🎯 ACHIEVEMENT - Complete Prompt System Modularization:

    ALL 3 STEPS NOW USE SAME STRUCTURE:
    - Step 1 (Transcribe): ✅ Modular prompts from j_ads_optimization_prompts
    - Step 2 (Process): ✅ Modular prompts from j_ads_optimization_prompts

    - Version tracking with previous_version field
    - Consistent structure across all steps
    - Better AI comprehension with clear section separators
    - No more hardcoded prompts in Edge Functions

  📝 CHANGES IN j_hub_optimization_analyze/index.ts:

    1. Account context fetching (lines 91-99):
       - Queries j_ads_notion_db_accounts
       - Fetches contexto_transcricao (for PROPER NAMES section)
       - Fetches contexto_otimizacao (for ADDITIONAL CONTEXT section)

    2. Fixed prompt_type (line 145):
       - Changed from 'analysis' → 'analyze'
       - Now correctly fetches prompts from database

    3. System prompt in English (lines 158-208):
       - Structural instructions in English
       - JSON schema specification
       - Added: "OUTPUT LANGUAGE: Brazilian Portuguese"

    4. User prompt with sections (lines 213-271):
       - PROPER NAMES AND CONTEXT
       - PLATFORM: X / OBJECTIVES: Y
       - FOCUS BY OBJECTIVE (from database)
       - ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT (conditional)
       - PROCESSED TRANSCRIPTION (ORGANIZED BULLETS)
       - Historical context (3 previous optimizations)
       - ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS (conditional)
       - TASK (with output format)

  🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
    - Edge Function: j_hub_optimization_analyze deployed ✅
    - Production URL: https://biwwowendjuzvpttyrlb.supabase.co
    - Migration: None needed (table structure already exists)
    - Frontend: No changes needed (uses existing UI)

  ⚠️ PENDING TASKS FOR NEXT SESSION:

    🧹 CLEANUP: Remove Obsolete Edge Functions

    ISSUE: Multiple legacy edge functions still exist with j_ads_ prefix
    but are no longer used (replaced by j_hub_ versions)

    NEXT STEPS:
    1. Audit all functions in supabase/functions/
    2. Identify legacy vs. active functions:
       - j_ads_* = Legacy (check if still used)
       - j_hub_* = New (keep)
    3. Search codebase for references to legacy functions
    4. Delete unused edge functions from repository
    5. Update supabase/config.toml to remove legacy entries

    KNOWN LEGACY FUNCTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
    - j_ads_analyze_optimization (replaced by j_hub_optimization_analyze)
    - j_ads_transcribe_optimization (replaced by j_hub_optimization_transcribe)
    - j_ads_process_optimization (replaced by j_hub_optimization_process)
    - Others TBD (need full audit)

  📦 MIGRATION STATUS:
    - Database: Up to date ✅
    - Edge Functions: 1 updated, many legacy to clean up ⚠️
    - Frontend: No changes needed ✅

  Known issues: Edge function cleanup pending

  All optimization features working perfectly! ✅
