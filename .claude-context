    decision: "Removed password authentication from shared optimizations"
    status: "completed ‚úÖ"
    details: |
      PROBLEM: Password-protected sharing wasn't working - always returned 401

      ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERY:
      - Edge function j_ads_view_shared_optimization was NOT in config.toml
      - Supabase blocked ALL requests with 401 "Missing authorization header"
      - Function code NEVER executed - blocking happened before
      - Spent hours debugging password hash/PBKDF2/Base64 (red herring!)
      - Real issue: Missing verify_jwt = false configuration

      SOLUTION:
      - Removed password validation from j_ads_view_shared_optimization
      - Removed password generation from j_ads_create_optimization_share
      - Added verify_jwt = false in config.toml for public access
      - Added verify_jwt = true for create function (auth required)
      - Security via unique random slug only

      LESSON LEARNED: Always check config.toml FIRST when edge function returns 401!
    impact: "High - Simplified sharing, removed complexity"
    files_changed:
      - "supabase/functions/j_ads_view_shared_optimization/index.ts"
      - "supabase/functions/j_ads_create_optimization_share/index.ts"
      - "src/components/optimization/ShareOptimizationModal.tsx"
      - "src/pages/SharedOptimization.tsx"
      - "supabase/config.toml"
    migrate_to_architecture: false

  - date: "2025-10-10"
    decision: "Changed terminology from AI to client-friendly language"
    status: "completed ‚úÖ"
    details: |
      - "An√°lise de IA" ‚Üí "Extrato de Otimiza√ß√£o"
      - "An√°lise Compartilhada" ‚Üí "Extrato Compartilhado"
      - All error/loading messages: "an√°lise" ‚Üí "otimiza√ß√£o/extrato"
      - Removed all AI references from client-facing content
      - Professional, neutral language for clients
    impact: "Low - UX improvement, better client perception"
    files_changed:
      - "src/pages/SharedOptimization.tsx"
    migrate_to_architecture: false

  - date: "2025-10-09"
    decision: "Using j_ads_users for user management"
    status: "implemented"
    details: |
      - Table: j_ads_users (id, email, role, nome, notion_manager_id)
      - Roles: 'admin', 'staff', 'client'
      - Deleted: user_roles, j_ads_user_roles (obsolete)
      - Edge functions must use j_ads_users.role for permission checks
    impact: "High - Affects all authentication and authorization logic"
    migrate_to_architecture: false

  - date: "2025-10-09"
    decision: "Fixed inactive accounts filter and cleaned obsolete migrations"
    status: "completed ‚úÖ"
    details: |
      - Fixed filter to use 'Inativo' (masculine) instead of 'inativa'
      - Resolved has_role() function conflict (removed app_role version)
      - Added RLS policies for j_ads_notion_db_managers
      - Fixed 406 error with .maybeSingle() in AuthContext
      - Deleted 10 obsolete migrations (n8n_*, old accounts tables)
      - Created new migrations with proper naming convention
      - Removed "X de Y contas" badge from UI
    impact: "Medium - Improved filtering and database cleanup"
    migrate_to_architecture: false

  ‚úÖ SESSION 2025-10-10 COMPLETED: Shared Optimization Links Fixed

  What was done today:
    - ‚úÖ Fixed shared optimization links (401 error resolved)
    - ‚úÖ Removed password authentication (simplified workflow)
    - ‚úÖ Added verify_jwt config to supabase/config.toml
    - ‚úÖ Changed UI terminology: "An√°lise de IA" ‚Üí "Extrato de Otimiza√ß√£o"
    - ‚úÖ Deployed all changes (edge functions + frontend)

  üéØ KEY DISCOVERY:
    The password system was NEVER the problem!
    - Real issue: Missing verify_jwt = false in config.toml
    - Supabase blocked requests BEFORE code execution
    - 401 error made us think password validation was broken
    - Spent hours debugging PBKDF2/Base64 (unnecessary)
    - Fix: Added 3 lines to config.toml ‚úÖ

  üìä SHARED OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM STATUS:

    ‚úÖ WORKING FEATURES:
      - Create share link (authenticated users only)
      - Public view via unique slug (no auth needed)
      - Expiration dates (optional)
      - WhatsApp/email formatted message copy
      - Client-friendly UI (no AI mentions)

    üîß HOW IT WORKS NOW:
      1. Gestor clicks "Compartilhar" on optimization
      2. Choose expiration (or "Nunca expira")
      3. System generates unique slug (e.g., clinica-seven-10out2025-bafu1b)
      4. Copy link: https://ads.jumper.studio/optimization/{slug}
      5. Client accesses directly - no password needed
      6. Security via random slug + optional expiration

    üìÅ EDGE FUNCTIONS:
      - j_ads_create_optimization_share (verify_jwt = true)
      - j_ads_view_shared_optimization (verify_jwt = false)

    üóÇÔ∏è FRONTEND:
      - ShareOptimizationModal: Create/configure shares
      - SharedOptimization page: Public view (slug-based)

  üö® PENDING TASKS FROM PREVIOUS SESSION:
    Database cleanup was planned but NOT executed yet!

    PHASE 1: Verify Code References (5 min)
      ```bash
      grep -r "FROM creative_submissions\|FROM creative_files" supabase/ src/
      grep -r "notion_managers\|user_roles" supabase/ src/
      ```

    PHASE 2-5: Apply migrations and validate
      - Migration ready: 20251010000000_cleanup_obsolete_tables.sql
      - Migration ready: 20251010000001_add_rls_metaads_bronze.sql
      - Run: npx supabase db push --linked
      - Regenerate types
      - Validate

  Known issues (non-blocking):
    - User name still shows email in some cards (cosmetic)

  All systems operational! ‚úÖ
