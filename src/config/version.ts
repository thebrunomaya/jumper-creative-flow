 *   - DIAGNOSTIC: Added detailed Supabase config logging
 *   - Shows URL, key source, and whether using local or production
 *   - Helps diagnose environment variable issues in production
 *
 * - v2.0.5 (2024-10-14):
 *   - CRITICAL FIX: Fixed .env configuration for local vs production
 *   - .env now contains PRODUCTION credentials (used by Vercel)
 *   - .env.local contains LOCAL credentials (gitignored, dev only)
 *   - No more switching env vars between local/production!
 *
 * - v2.0.4 (2024-10-14):
 *   - CRITICAL FIX: Corrected environment variable name mismatch
 *   - Code was looking for VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
 *   - Vercel has VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
 *   - Now checks both + correct production fallback
 *

 *   - Fixed production login issues (email + Notion OAuth)
 *   - Improved userExists() with RLS-safe fallback strategy
