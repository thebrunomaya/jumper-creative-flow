/**
 * Version history:
 * - v2.0.10 (2024-10-15):
 *   - FIX: Optimization RLS policies now allow admins to view ALL recordings
 *   - Added policies: "Admins can view/update all transcripts" and "Admins can view/update all context"
 *   - Fixed issue where admin users couldn't access optimizations created by other users
 *   - Migration: 20251015000000_fix_optimization_rls_for_admins.sql
 *
 * - v2.0.9 (2024-10-15):
 *   - FIX: start-dev.sh now runs Vite in background (prevents timeout/zombie process)
 *   - Script completes successfully on first run (no more "second try" needed)
 *   - Logs saved to /tmp/vite-dev.log for debugging
 *   - Clear success message with URL and log locations
 *
 * - v2.0.8 (2024-10-15):
 *   - DEV SETUP: Added Edge Functions to start-dev.sh script (auto-start)
 *   - DOCS: Updated DEV-SETUP.md with Edge Functions requirement (critical step)
 *   - DOCS: Updated CLAUDE.md workflow to include Edge Functions
 *   - FIX: Prevents "Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code" error

 *
 * - v2.0.7 (2024-10-14):
 *   - PRODUCTION FIX: Resolved login issues caused by corrupted Vercel env vars
 *   - Root cause: Vercel environment variables had invalid API key format
 *   - Solution: Removed Vercel env vars, app now uses hardcoded fallback values
 *   - Removed diagnostic logs from v2.0.6 (no longer needed)
 *   - Login with email and Notion OAuth both working in production âœ…
 *
 * - v2.0.6 (2024-10-14):
 *   - DIAGNOSTIC: Added detailed Supabase config logging
 *   - Shows URL, key source, and whether using local or production
 *   - Helps diagnose environment variable issues in production
 *
 * - v2.0.5 (2024-10-14):
 *   - CRITICAL FIX: Fixed .env configuration for local vs production

 *
 * - v2.0.4 (2024-10-14):
 *   - CRITICAL FIX: Corrected environment variable name mismatch
