## STRATEGIC OPTIMIZATION IMPACT

**Date: October 23, 2025**

Following four weeks of consistent data showing EH campaigns underperforming at 8.6x higher cost/conversion than account average, all EH campaigns were paused and budget reallocated to proven EVC structure.

**Action Taken:**

- Paused: All 12 EH campaigns (Display + Search)
- Reallocated: $10.35/day distributed across 12 active EVC campaigns
- Rationale: Four periods of data validated EVC + Quiz as the winning formula. Strategic decision to scale proven structure rather than optimize underperforming campaigns.

**Results this period demonstrate validation and successful scaling.**

## 6. Next Steps

**Immediate (Week 6):**

1. **Monitor Saturation Signals:**
    - Honduras Search showing efficiency drop - watch for similar patterns in other markets
    - Key metrics: CPC >$0.04, conv rate <4%, frequency >4x
2. **Optimize High-Volume Campaigns:**
    - Colombia Search (106 conv) and Panama Display (93 conv) proving scale capacity
    - Test incremental 15-20% budget increases in these specific campaigns
3. **Address Policy Restrictions:**
    - Most campaigns still showing "limited by policy" status
    - Creative refresh focusing on lifestyle/wellness language vs medical terminology

**Medium-Term (Weeks 7-8):**

- Continue monitoring CPC inflation trend
- Test audience expansion in mature campaigns (Colombia, Panama)
- Evaluate if current budget represents optimal spend level or if further scaling viable

**Campaign Status:** Portfolio fully optimized on proven EVC structure. Five weeks of data confirm strategic direction. Budget reallocation from EH exceeded projections. Ready for controlled expansion testing in high-performing markets.
